# Pomodoro Timer for visual studio code 

This is a very simple pomodoro timer for visual studio code.
Nowadays a lot of developers works with vscode and pomodoro technique. I am one of them. So for this reason I developed this extensi√≥n. 

## How to use it
For use it, you only need to click over the timer in status bar (right). The first click start the timer and the second click pause the timer.

If you want to start, pause, resume or reset the timer, you can use the command palette. Find the commands using the pomodoro word.

## Custom settings
The extension has some configuration options. For example, you can configure the pomodoro block, get notification when pomodoro is finished and custom the label in status bar.
